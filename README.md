#Bonus Calculator - Object Upgrade

I upgraded the employee to objects rather than arrays of info.

I'm not quite finished and am having issues getting the bonus calculator to
access the employees array. I will keep working on it until it works but am
submitting it as is for now (9.23.16).

I ran into a git issue that prevented me from submitting it yesterday as originally planned, but that did allow me to work with Danny some before lunch. As a result, I learned some better ways to troubleshoot through small chunks of code at a time. I've gotten a little closer but still haven't been able to access the array for the final printout. I would be grateful for any suggestions! Also, I am going to complete my weekend assignment and then return to this assignment.
(9.24.16)

I returned to this calculator 10.22.16 and am quite a few steps closer in a short amount of time. The calculator is accessing the array correctly, but I will need to revisit this to fix the actual calculations. Currently, it is not calculating bonuses correctly.
